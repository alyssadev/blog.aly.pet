So, yeah, life goes on. Hi. I'm living in Brisbane now, diagnosed and medicated for ADHD, just diagnosed for autism, checking off boxes young-me could only dream of. I go by Aly now, I play a lot of FFXIV, I've recently had so much damn creativity for completing little projects and in posting a wall of text and images to discord channels I realised I have a blog! So the [following post](/2023-09-16-projects) might cover some of them, who knows.
