Today my good friend Jeviny asked me to make her a song video for a track on her new album so she could put it on Youtube. Nothing fancy, just a still image of the album art with the album intro in the background. So I spent 15 minutes writing a tool to do that.

First I figured out how to do it with ffmpeg.

```bash
ffmpeg -loop 1 -i image.jpg -i audio.mp3 -shortest -c:v libx264 -tune stillimage -c:a libfdk_aac sv_audio.mp4
```

Then I took that, and dumped it into a [Python module](https://github.com/blha303/songvid/blob/master/songvid/songvid.py#L9). Pretty simple stuff.
