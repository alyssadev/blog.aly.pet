  <h1>Job hunting</h1>
  <content>
    <p>I gave my resume in to a recruitment agency two days ago. Called today to
follow up on it, the guy said he could have something for me. He mentioned
keeping my Github profile up to date... Probably didn't mean a blog post :P</p>
<p>I'm pretty excited about the idea of actually having a job. I got this grand
plan to get a list of addresses of all of my internet friends, mainly from
IRC, and fly around the world to visit them all. If I just want to go from
Perth to Brisbane to SF (driving to LA cos it's 'only' 7 hours) to Illinois
to Vancouver to Perth, it would be a total of $3000 ish, so I'd need probably
$5000. I mentioned this to my friends, and some of them said "why don't you
visit me in &lt;EU country&gt;?" That's a good idea, it would make the trip back to
Perth easier, but definitely cost a lot more.</p>
<p>I'd probably go Perth-Brisbane(via syd)-SF(via syd)-LA by car-
Vancouver-Illinois-New York(while I'm in the area)-London-Amsterdam-Helsinki-
Perth(via singapore), subject to change if anyone else is in cities along the
way. I'd need $15k for that, minimum. Haven't researched prices for that yet.
Sounds like a lot of money, but... Ideally I would have the presence of mind
to put away savings, plan time off, y'know, all that adult stuff I haven't
had to do up til this point. I guess we'll see. First step is getting a job.</p>
